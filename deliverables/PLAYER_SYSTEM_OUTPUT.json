  "summary": "Complete player movement system with smooth acceleration-based physics. Implements dash (400px/s), wall jump, double jump, and glide abilities. Includes coyote time (0.1s) and jump buffer (0.1s) for responsive platforming feel. All movement tuning centralized in PhysicsConstants for easy adjustment. Events emitted for all major actions to decouple from other systems.",
  "usage_instructions": "Instantiate in GameScene: this.player = new PlayerController(this, x, y); Call update(delta, input) every frame with InputManager instance. Listen to player events via EventBus for integration with other systems. Unlock abilities with unlockAbility('dash') to enable special moves."
