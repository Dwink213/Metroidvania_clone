  "summary": "All 9 systems successfully wired together in GameScene. Event flow established for room transitions, combat, abilities, and game over. Physics collisions configured for player vs platforms/walls and combat detection. Main menu supports New Game and Continue (with save detection). GameScene.update() calls all systems in proper order. Save/load system captures player health, abilities, current room, and defeated enemies. Integration tests validate all 12 core integration points. Game is ready for testing and validation phase.",
  "usage_instructions": "Open index.html in browser. BootScene loads game data, then shows MainMenuScene. Click New Game to start in room_01. Player moves with WASD/Arrows, jumps with Space. ESC pauses game. Systems communicate via EventBus - no tight coupling. All systems update every frame via GameScene.update(). Save game via pause menu (saves to LocalStorage). Continue from main menu to restore progress."
